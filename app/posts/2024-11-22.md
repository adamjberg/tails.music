## "When I grow up, I want to be a gambler"

I used to laugh at myself for how silly my child self was to think this. It wasn't until recently that it dawned on me that being an entreprenuer is essentially being a professional gambler.

## Bootstrapping is Hard

For the last year or so, I have been gambling (I mean investing) my time and money in building a SaaS business. It's exhilarating at first, and then the doubts creep in. It's hard not to wonder sometimes if I'm just gambling it away.

## Doubt Comes In

These doubts claw at the back of my mind on a daily basis. I know the path to where I want to go and know that I just need to keep going, but doubt constantly pulls from behind slowing me down.

I'm writing this to let pressure out of the system, to look back on what this period felt like, and to let others know that this is a normal part of the process.

## Gratitude for My Support System

I'm incredibly lucky to have an amazing team and support network through friends and family. I don't often have the energy to fully show this appreciation, but I would have stopped long ago without it.
